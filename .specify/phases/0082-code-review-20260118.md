# Phase 0082: Code Review 20260118

**Created**: 2026-01-18
**Status**: In Progress
**Source**: `.specify/reviews/review-20260118-115354.md`

## Goal

Implement 59 approved findings from the full codebase review to improve code quality, security, and maintainability.

## Scope

| Category | Count | Focus |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Best Practices (BP) | 8 | Error handling, type safety |
| Refactoring (RF) | 11 | Code organization, DRY |
| Hardening (HD) | 14 | Security, validation, race conditions |
| Missing Features (MF) | 7 | Complete incomplete implementations |
| Orphaned Code (OC) | 9 | Remove dead code |
| Outdated Docs (OD) | 10 | Update documentation |

**Total Effort Points**: 107
**High Severity Items**: RF003 (health.ts 213 lines), OC007 (18k deprecated bash)

## Deliverables

- [ ] All BP findings implemented (error handling improvements)
- [ ] All RF findings implemented (code refactoring)
- [ ] All HD findings implemented (security hardening)
- [ ] All MF findings implemented (complete features)
- [ ] All OC findings implemented (dead code removed)
- [ ] All OD findings implemented (docs updated)

## Verification Gate

- All 59 approved findings from review are addressed
- Tests pass after refactoring
- No new linting errors introduced
- Documentation reflects current CLI behavior

---

## Notes

- 13 Over-Engineering (OE) findings deferred to BACKLOG.md for user validation
- Review identified ~25,000 lines analyzed across 50+ files
- Priority: High severity items RF003 and OC007 first
